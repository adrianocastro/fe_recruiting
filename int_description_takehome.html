Hi <u>FNAME</u>,

I'd like to invite you in for the 2nd round! One of our recruiters from HR will
be contacting you shortly to arrange a time and date. To prepare you, here is
the format of our interview:


INTERVIEW FORMAT

[30 min]  Code Review

We start off with a standard code review of your take-home exercise. Please be
prepared to demonstrate it either on your own laptop or on one of our machines
(Win2K, IE6, Acrobat, PowerPoint, no Flash) with web access.

Also please send me your code so I can make photocopies of it for the
interviewers. This code review will involve 2-3 frontend engineers.

[60 min]  In-House Exercise

You are given 60 minutes to complete an exercise in our office. If you bring
your own laptop, you are free to use it. Otherwise, you can use our machine
(only Notepad is offered, since it's not a development system). You are also
welcome to use your own books or favorite web sites.

[30 min]  In-House Exercise Code Review

This review is similar in format to the first code review, except it will be on
the screen instead of paper.

[30 min]  Additional interviews

Held in a one-on-one format, these allow other members of the team, from
designers to product managers to backend engineers, to meet you.



Thanks! I look forward to receiving your code and speaking with you again soon!
