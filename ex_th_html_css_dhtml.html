<p>Please take a look at the <a href="ex_th_html_css_dhtml.html" onclick="yg_popup('ex_th_screenshot.html?frontpage_inthenews_module.gif','screenshot',800,600,2);return false">attached GIF image</a>. The highlighted area is the In The News Module. The intended functionality is:</p>

<p>The module is moveable and draggable anywhere on the page. To do this, the user has to position the cursor over the "In The News" tab and hold the mouse button down.</p>

<p>The code should be semantically proper and display with visual fidelity in IE5+/NS7.1+ and degrade to a non-stylized layout that still retains some form of information hierarchy and usability for older browsers. Drag functionality should be disabled for older browsers as well. The code should be accessible and retain its aspect ratio if the user changes the browser or platform's text size settings. Optimize for download & render speed.</p>

<p>When you are finished, please send us the code and all associated files. You only need to build the highlighted module. You can choose to place it on its own page or build fake content around it; we will not look at any code other than the highlighted module. You may use fake images for the purposes of this exercise.</p>
