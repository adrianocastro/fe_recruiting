<h1>Resume Assessment Guidelines</h1>

<p>The purpose of the resume assessment is to determine if the candidate is worth a phone screen. Since it can be difficult to make an accurate technical assessment, this phase is just to weed out those who are obviously not qualified (e.g. wrong role, more of a designer or backend engineer, etc).</p>

<hr>

<p>In order of importance:

<ol>
<li><strong>Check personal website & sample code</strong>

	<ul>
	<li>This can give a fairly good view of the candidate's skill set; it's not always current, but is the best indicator of demonstrated skill; a personal site also shows an interest in web development</li>
	<li>What kind of technologies does the candidate use/know?</li>
	<li>What is the candidate trying to communicate with site? Is it a personal site? A hobby site? A professional/freelance site?</li>
	<li>Any Dreamweaver/library code in there?</li>
	<li>Any demonstrations of innovation or use of own code?</li>
	<li>At what skill level does this code show the candidate to be?</li>
	</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Check job progression</strong>

	<ul>
	<li>This can give an overall view of the candidate's actual experience; it's more accurate than other items on resume</li>
	<li>What kinds of roles has this person held?</li>
	<li>Is this candidate on a management track or individual contributor track?</li>
	<li>How long was the candidate at each job?</li>
	<li>Did the candidate ever relocate?</li>
	<li>Are the past duties relevant to our role?</li>
	</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Check education</strong>

	<ul>
	<li>This can give a very general idea of the candidate's abilities, though it's not always accurate</li>
	<li>What kind of degree does the candidate have?</li>
	<li>What university did the candidate attend?</li>
	<li>When did candidate graduate?</li>
	</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Check skills</strong>

	<ul>
	<li>Only gives a very general view and is hardly ever accurate</li>
	<li>Does candidate list the basic skills we're looking for?</li>
	<li>How many years has the candidate been using this skill?</li>
	</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Check interests/hobbies/extracurricular activities</strong>

	<ul>
	<li>Only gives a very general view and most don't even list it; only provides additional info on candidate</li>
	<li>Are there any matching interests to the product/property?</li>
	<li>Are there any artistic/creative or problem-solving/puzzle interests?</li>
	</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Check current location</strong>

	<ul>
	<li>This can tell you whether or not it will take longer to interview and hire this candidate, especially if candidate is out-of-state; it's is mostly useful as additional administrative info</li>
	<li>Does this candidate require relocation?</li>
	<li>Do phone screens have to be made with consideration to time zones?</li>
	</ul>

</li>
</ol>
