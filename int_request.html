<h1>Interview Request</h1>

The interview format I use is different than typical engineering interviews here
at Yahoo. Exercises (take-home and in-house) and code reviews are part of the
interview process and only the LAST THREE SLOTS can be swapped with each other.
The below suggested schedule can be used:

1:00 to 1:30 - [30m] Take-home exercise code review (frontend eng group)
1:30 to 2:30 - [60m] In-house exercise (candidate alone in room)
2:30 to 3:00 - [30m] In-house exercise code review (frontend eng group)
3:00 to 3:30 - [30m] Interview slot (product representative)
3:30 to 4:00 - [30m] Interview slot (backend eng representative)
4:00 to 4:30 - [30m] Interview slot (UED representative)


Thanks! Please let me know if you have any questions.
