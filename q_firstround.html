<h1>1st Round Interview Questions</h1>

<p>The 1st round interview should only take about an hour for yourself. You can have a lead or senior member of your team join you or take an interview slot after yours if you would like more feedback about the candidate.</p>

<p>By the end of this round, you should be able to make a preliminary assessment of the candidate's HR grade/level (e.g. L6 low, L7 high), have more accurate knowledge of the candidate's skill levels, and have a gut feeling about whether or not he/she would make a good cultural fit within your team.</p>

<p>These sample questions can help you assess the candidate's technical competency.</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>
		<strong>General</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>All levels</strong> -
				Tell me about yourself.<br>
				<div class="details">This is a common open-ended question that can be a good first question to give a candidate. It gives a candidate a chance to sell him/herself and tell you about his/her background, previous job experience, and how the candidate sees him/herself.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>All levels</strong> -
				Tell me about the proudest achievement of your career.<br>
				<div class="details">Pay attention to the achievement he/she talks about, how he/she is able to communicate the story, and from what point of view he/she takes in the story.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>All levels</strong> -
				Why are you interested in leaving your current position?<br>
				<div class="details">Some of the candidate's motivations can be gleamed from this answer.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>All levels</strong> -
				Out of the previous places that you've worked, in which work environment did you feel most effective? Why?<br>
				<div class="details">This is to get a sense of what kind of work environment he/she would prefer, without asking him/her directly: Do you like process-oriented or loose environments? Because with that question, everyone says they are right in the middle.</div>
			</li>
			<li><strong>All levels</strong> -
				And which work environments did you feel most frustrated? Why?<br>
				<div class="details">This can sometimes get even more accurate answers about the candidate's work environment preferences. The third question can overlap with this one a bit.</div>

	<li>
		<strong>JS</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Level 2-3</strong> - 
				Are you familiar with the term Ajax or the XmlHTTPRequest object in JavaScript? Say you were given the task of creating an abstraction object for that functionality. How would you design that object?<br>
				<div class="details">Check to see if the candidate covers these topics: encapsulation, private &amp; public methods, cross-browser compatibility &amp; degradation, exception/error handling, history object handling, inheritance &amp; prototype object, remote scripting, iframe alternative, script node alternative.</div>
