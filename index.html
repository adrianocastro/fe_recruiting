	<h3>Determine Skill Levels</h3>
	
	<ol>
	<li>
		<p>The skills of a frontend engineer can be placed into three main categories:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Style &amp; Layout (CSS)</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Since CSS is such a new technology, writing and debugging it is a creative, investigative task. The conceptual model of CSS is very different from markup or scripting languages. Strong CSS developers will also understand the box model and cross-browser issues.</p>
				<p>Skills include are: HTML, XHTML, CSS1, CSS2, specificity, inheritance, selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, box model issues, display types, float rules, positioning rules, units, doctypes, quirks mode, standards mode, web standards, semantic markup, cross-browser hacks &amp; filters, accessibility, internationalization, optimization.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>DOM Scripting (JS)</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>JavaScript emphasizes event-driven programming, where the control flow of its scripts are largely driven by browser events, and DOM manipulation, where nodes can be created, modified, and removed in memory and without a page refresh. Strong JS developers will also understand cross-browser issues.</p>
				<p>Skills include are: JavaScript 1.2, JavaScript 1.5, ECMAScript, DOM0, DOM1, DOM2, programming fundamentals, data types, data manipulation, regular expressions, node manipulation, dynamic content retrieval, object-oriented programming, event-driven programming, event models, cross-browser issues, optimization.</p>
				</dd>
			<dt>Server-side Integration (PHP)</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>PHP is the primary server-side integration language used here. Object, array, and string manipulation are the main tasks used in the presentation layer of PHP. Strong PHP developers will also understand HTTP, get/post, and file caching.</p>
				<p>Skills include are: PHP4, PHP5, MySQL, Apache, Unix, command-line programming, HTTP headers, get/post requests, file caching, programming fundamentals, data types, data manipulation, regular expressions, object-oriented programming, database connectivity, state management, version control, internationalization, optimization.</p>
			</dd>
		</dl>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<p>Determine the skill level required for each of the three skill categories:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Level 0:</strong> none - no knowledge or experience with this skill</li>
			<li><strong>Level 1:</strong> beginner/junior - some working knowledge, can modify existing code, needs guidance and frequent code reviews</li>
			<li><strong>Level 2:</strong> intermediate/mid - several years of experience with this skill, can write own code, can be an independent worker</li>
			<li><strong>Level 3:</strong> advanced/senior - strong experience with advanced concepts, go-to person and mentor, can lead code reviews</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Examples:</p>
<pre class="examples">
<b>Position One</b>     <b>Position Two</b>
CSS: 1           CSS: 3
JS:  2           JS:  1
PHP: 2           PHP: 1
</pre>
	</li>
	</ol>
	
</li>

<li>
<a name="write_job_description"></a>
	<h3>Write Job Description</h3>
	<p>Write a property-specific job description. Include property-specific qualifications and any distinguishing qualities or exciting opportunities that can help attract candidates to your position.</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="req_frontend.html">Frontend Engineer</a> - updated generic description</li>
		<li><a href="req_frontpage.html">Frontend Engineer for Yahoo.com</a></li>
		<li><a href="req_registration.html">Frontend Engineer for Registration & Core Services</a></li>
		<li><a href="req_communities.html">Frontend Engineer for Communities</a></li>
		<li><a href="req_photos.html">Frontend Engineer for Yahoo! Photos</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a name="publish_job_description"></a>
	<h3>Publish Job Description</h3>
	<p>Work with HR to post job description on careers.yahoo.com and other job listing sites. Track your candidates on Resumix. Although headhunter/talent agencies may be used to increase the candidate flow, most of them charge exorbitant finders fees and Yahoo may not be able afford them.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<a name="candidate_identification"></a>
<h2>Candidate Identification</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<a name="review_resumes"></a>
	<h3>Review Resumes</h3>
	<p>Assess each resume and rate the candidate based on the skill levels above. This is just a preliminary estimation; each candidate's ratings will change and be updated as he/she progresses through the recruiting process. These ratings should be used as a qualifier for the next step.</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="assess_resume.html">Resume assessment guidelines</a></li>
	</ul>
<pre class="examples">
<b>Candidate One</b>     <b>Candidate Two</b>     <b>Candidate Three</b>     <b><s>Candidate Four</s></b>
CSS: 1            CSS: 3            CSS: 2              CSS: 1
JS:  2            JS:  1            JS:  2              JS:  0
PHP: 2            PHP: 0            PHP: 1              PHP: 0
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<a name="phone_screen"></a>
	<h3>Phone Screen</h3>
	<p>Contact candidates by phone (or email if a phone number isn't available). Phone screens should be short, between 15-30 minutes only. The goal is to get a more accurate rating of each skill and confirm the candidate's interest in the position.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Briefly introduce yourself, the company, the position requirements and responsibilities</li>
		<li>Confirm the interest for the role</li>
		<li>Ask high-level technical questions to gauge the candidate's skill level</li>
		<li>Ask for an email of code samples and URLs of previous work</li>
		<li>(Optional) Tell the candidate about the take-home exercise if you want him/her to do it</li>
		<li>Tell the candidate about the next steps</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Revise the candidate's skill ratings (usually, the ratings will drop after your phone screen discovers that they don't know as much as you thought they did, although occasionally you'll find a star candidate).</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="q_phonescreen.html">Sample phone screen questions</a></li>
	</ul>
<pre class="examples">
<b><s>Candidate One</s></b>     <b>Candidate Two</b>     <b>Candidate Three</b>     <b><s>Candidate Four</s></b>
CSS: 1            CSS: 2            CSS: 3              CSS: 1
JS:  1            JS:  1            JS:  3              JS:  0
PHP: 1            PHP: 1            PHP: 2              PHP: 0
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<a name="send_take_home_exercise"></a>
	<h3>Send Take-Home Exercise</h3>
	<p>This step is optional, though some hiring managers may wish to make it required in order to normalize each candidate's technical abilities. Choose a relevant take-home exercise or create one yourself that best matches the skill needs. Ideally, the exercise should match the property for which this candidate is interviewing. These exercises also should be updated periodically so candidates don't publish them to the public. Email it to the candidate and give him/her a timeline of one week.</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_css.html">HTML/CSS v1</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_css_2.html">HTML/CSS v2</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_css_3.html">HTML/CSS v3</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_css_dhtml.html">HTML/CSS/DHTML</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_dhtml.html">HTML/DHTML</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_js.html">HTML/JS v1</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_html_js_2.html">HTML/JS v2</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_php_dhtml.html">PHP/DHTML</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_php_js.html">PHP/JS v1</a></li>
		<li><a href="ex_th_php_js_2.html">PHP/JS v2</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a name="review_code"></a>
	<h3>Review Code</h3>
	<p>Assess the candidate's code samples, URLs, and take-home exercise (if assigned). Look for practical applications the skills in which you need. Sometimes, a candidate will be able to surprise you by quickly learning a previously unknown skill. As you review his/her code, consider these factors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Compatibility on different browsers</li>
		<li>Appearance of JavaScript/PHP errors</li>
		<li>Understanding of web standards</li>
		<li>Understanding of accessibility</li>
		<li>Understanding of internationalization</li>
		<li>Clean code grammar (understanding of data types, use of control structures, etc)</li>
		<li>Knowledge of advanced concepts (object-oriented programming, data abstraction, separation of code layers, etc)</li>
		<li>Use of borrowed code from elsewhere (Dreamweaver, public domain scripts, etc)</li>
		<li>Download and rendering performance optimization</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the candidate completed the take-home exercise, also consider these factors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Adherence to instructions</li>
		<li>Visual fidelity to designs</li>
		<li>Above-and-beyond embellishments</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Revise the candidate's skill ratings again. You should be getting a more and more accurate assessment of each candidate's skills by this time. Remove those that don't pass and move the qualified ones to the interview stage.</p>
<pre class="examples">
<b><s>Candidate One</s></b>     <b>Candidate Two</b>     <b>Candidate Three</b>     <b><s>Candidate Four</s></b>
CSS: 1            CSS: 3            CSS: 3              CSS: 1
JS:  1            JS:  1            JS:  3              JS:  0
PHP: 1            PHP: 1            PHP: 2              PHP: 0
</pre>
</li>

</ol>

<a name="interview"></a>
<h2>Interview</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<a name="invite_candidate_for_1st_round"></a>
	<h3>Invite Candidate for 1st Round</h3>
	<p>Call the candidate and invite him/her in for a 1st round interview. This interview should only be for an hour or so. The goal is to be able to make a preliminary HR grade/level assessment (e.g. L7 low, L9 high), delve deeper into technical competency, and assess potential team fit.</p>
	<p>For a second opinion, you can opt to have a lead or senior member of your team pair up with you, or have him/her interview the candidate right after you're done.</p>
	<p>Example:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="q_firstround.html">1st Round Interview Questions</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Make a quick assessment of the candidate.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Potential grade/level?</li>
		<li>Potential technical competency?</li>
		<li>Potential team fit?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Revise the candidate's skill ratings one more time. Remove those that don't pass and move the qualified ones to the interview stage.</p>
<pre class="examples">
<b><s>Candidate One</s></b>     <b><s>Candidate Two</s></b>     <b>Candidate Three</b>     <b><s>Candidate Four</s></b>
CSS: 1            CSS: 1            CSS: 3              CSS: 1
JS:  1            JS:  1            JS:  3              JS:  0
PHP: 1            PHP: 1            PHP: 2              PHP: 0
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<a name="invite_candidate_for_2nd_round"></a>
	<h3>Invite Candidate for 2nd Round</h3>
	<p>Call the candidate and invite him/her in for an interview. You can have HR schedule the interview for you or do it yourself. To have HR schedule an interview, submit an Interview Request to your interview scheduler. If you invite the candidate yourself, send him/her a description of the interview so the candidate can adequately prepare for it.</p>
	<p>Example:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="int_request.html">Interview Request to HR</a></li>
		<li><a href="int_description_takehome.html">Interview Description to candidate</a> (with take-home exercise)</li>
		<li><a href="int_description_owncode.html">Interview Description to candidate</a> (<strong>without</strong> take-home exercise)</li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a name="schedule_interview_for_2nd_round"></a>
	<h3>Schedule Interview</h3>
	<p>If you are handling the interview schedule yourself, you will have to check for each interviewer's availability and reserve a conference room that can hold up to 4 people. An HR recruiter can easily do this for you though.</p>
	<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="examples">
1:00 to 1:30 - Take-home Exercise Code Review : frontend eng group
1:30 to 2:30 - In-house Exercise
2:30 to 3:00 - In-house Exercise Code Review  : frontend eng group
3:00 to 3:30 - Interview Slot                 : product representative
3:30 to 4:00 - Interview Slot                 : backend eng representative
4:00 to 4:30 - Interview Slot                 : UED representative
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<a name="interview_candidate_for_2nd_round"></a>
	<h3>Interview Candidate</h3>
	<p>The Code Reviews will provide practical examples of current knowledge. If the reviews end early or don't provide enough information, additional technical questions can be asked.</p>
	<p>Examples:</p>
	<ul class="examples">
		<li><a href="q_css.html">Interview Questions for CSS</a></li>
		<li><a href="q_js.html">Interview Questions for JS/DHTML/DOM</a></li>
		<li><a href="q_php.html">Interview Questions for PHP</a></li>
	</ul>
</li>

<li>
<a name="assess_candidate_for_2nd_round"></a>
	<h3>Assess Candidate</h3>
	<p>Asses candidate at Candidate Review session to make a recruiting decision:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>No - Low interest, below average candidate</li>
		<li>Wait - Average candidate, backburner and continue to interview other candidates</li>
		<li>Proceed - Good candidate, additional review/interviews if necessary</li>
		<li>Hire - Excellent candidate, high interest, fast-track candidate (a rare rating to receive)</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
