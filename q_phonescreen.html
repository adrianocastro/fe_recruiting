<h1>Phone Screen Questions</h1>

<p>The purpose of the phone screen is to determine if the candidate is worth bringing in for a short 1st round interview. This is not meant to be a thorough technical assessment, only a high-level assessment of the candidate's skills and interest in the position. Therefore, these questions are merely high-level guidelines. Specific questions tailored to the candidate's previous work experience can also be used. The levels listed below can help gauge the candidate's skill rating.</p>
