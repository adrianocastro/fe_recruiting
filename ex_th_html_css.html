<p>Please take a look at the <a href="ex_th_html_css.html" onclick="yg_popup('ex_th_screenshot.html?frontpage_modules.gif','screenshot',800,600,2);return false">attached GIF image</a>. The highlighted areas are the Property List Module and the In The News Module. The intended functionality is:</p>

<p>The code should be semantically proper and display with visual fidelity in IE5+/NS7.1+ and degrade to a non-stylized layout that still retains some form of information hierarchy and usability for older browsers. It should also be accessible and retain its aspect ratio if the user changes the browser or platform's text size settings. Optimize for download & render speed.</p>

<p>When you are finished, please send us the code and all associated files. You only need to build the two highlighted modules. You can choose to place them on their own page or build fake content around them; we will not look at any code other than the two highlighted modules. You may use fake images for the purposes of this exercise.</p>
