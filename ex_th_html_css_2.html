<p>Please take a look at the <a href="ex_th_html_css_2.html" onclick="yg_popup('ex_th_screenshot.html?personals_modules.gif','screenshot',800,300,2);return false">attached GIF image</a>. These are modules from the actual logged-in homepage of Yahoo! Personals (http://personals.yahoo.com). Currently, they are built with HTML tables. Please rewrite the same layout using a CSS-driven approach. In other words, rewrite it without using HTML tables (other HTML tags are fine). You can use the graphic as a guide for pixel widths. Please have this entire layout centered on a page, as it is on the current page.</p>

<p>The code should be semantically proper and display with visual fidelity in IE5+/NS7.1+ and degrade to a non-stylized layout that still retains some form of information hierarchy and usability for older browsers. Optimize for download & render speed.</p>

<p>When you are finished, please send us the code and all associated files. You may use fake images for the purposes of this exercise.</p>
